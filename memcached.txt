view vs stored procedure:
A view represents a virtual table.

from a single table.

A stored procedure uses parameters to do a function... whether it is updating and inserting data, or
 returning single values or data sets.

View can be defined as a virtual table created as a result of the query expression. However,
 Materialized View is a physical copy, picture or snapshot of the base table.
